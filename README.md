## Wikipedia Traffic Prediction

### Concept
Conceptually the idea is to aggregate data and create derived features (using Spark SQL and dataframes) to get the data ready for an out-of-the-box MLib classification algorithm. The target of the analysis could be to predict if there will be an x% increase in traffic for a topic. We can treat this as a time-series analysis and do some feature engineering around time-lagged features and relevant topics.
